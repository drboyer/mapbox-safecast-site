## building and running

frontend javascript work happens in the .js files in the src/ directory.

After making changes, run this to compile them into a single **map.js** file in dist/:

```
npm run build
```

The easiest way to view the site locally is to run the following command from the base of this repo:

```
python -mSimpleHTTPServer
```

you'll then find the site running at http://localhost:8000/dist/
